  <p>Right now we have a way to have a table of contents on the home page with a java 
    script *thing* to auto-update the table of contents based on a .json file. 
    I have no clue how js works at all so lets hope ChatGPT knows what its doing!
    Next move is to try and make a script to auto-update the .json but anything that isn't
    html or css scares me so it'll probably break but ah well.</p>
