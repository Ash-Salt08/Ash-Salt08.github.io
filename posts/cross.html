      <h1>† - Justice</h1>
      <h3>7/08/2025</h3>
      <hr />
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        † is the debut album by Justice, and my absolute favorite album of all
        time. People older than me normally compare this album to rock, disco,
        and whatnot, but I feel that I have a different perspective on it. I
        didn't grow up listening to rock or disco, so I don't have that
        nostalgia for it. Instead, I spent most of my childhood listening to a
        lot of Daft Punk, as well as whatever "Aussie classics" my parents would
        play, so I had no preconceptions about what † was supposed to sound
        like.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I heard about Justice first online, fresh off Daft Punk's
        breakup, with people saying that Justice is the spiritual successor to
        Daft Punk. I wrote this off initially, as I didn't (and still don't)
        think anyone else can capture what made Daft Punk so amazing. Fast
        forward to 2023 or 2024 and I'm watching John Wick: Chapter 4, which is
        probably my favorite movie ever (Movie review soon?). JW4 captivated me
        through its action, visual style, and most importantly, its music. The
        bulk of the soundtrack was by Le Castle Vania, who I looked up on
        Spotify and loved the music I found there. In particular, I had his
        playlist "DARK ELECTRONIC WEEKLY" on repeat, which featured a lot of the
        JW4 soundtrack, most notably including "Hate or Glory" by Gesaffelstein
        (a song from another one of my favourite albums ever, Aleph), and
        "Genesis" by Justice.

      <p>
        The name "Justice" rang a bell, and I remembered how they were
        celebrated as the next Daft Punk, so I decided to spin up their debut
        album, †.

      <h2>The Listening Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I'm not a music critic, so I'm not going to pretend to know too much
        about what makes good production or a good song or whatever. What I can
        talk about is how the album made me feel, and describe the rollercoaster
        of an album † is in the hopes it may persuade at least one person to
        give it a listen. And holy shit, is this album worth the listen. I'm
        going to go through it track-by-track, then give my overall thoughts and
        feelings on the whole album and give it a rating out of 10. If you
        haven't already, give it a listen. I don't want to spoil what is one of
        the greatest musical experiences for you!

      <h3>Genesis</h3>
      <p>
        Probably the most iconic song in the album. It's heavy, it's dramatic,
        and it's the perfect song for the JW4 scene it's in. I love it to bits.
      </p>

      <h3>Let There Be Light</h3>
      <p>
        This track leads on perfectly from Genesis. I often wish that Genesis
        and LTBL were one track because they fit together so well. This is a
        very underappreciated track. The drums are mesmerising at the start and
        the rest of the track is more of the distorted goodness that makes † so
        great.
      </p>

      <h3>D.A.N.C.E.</h3>
      <p>
        This is the more mainstream track on the album, which I only realised
        because my sister recognised it from some Trolls movie (alongside Daft
        Punk's One More Time). That being said, it's still such a vibe. I feel
        like it contrasts the rest of the album, but that's not a bad thing.
      </p>

      <h3>Newjack</h3>
      <p>Love this one again. Underrated gem again.</p>

      <h3>Phantom</h3>
      <p>
        This song is amazing, but I still can't help but feel like it's a really
        long intro to Phantom Pt. II.
      </p>

      <h3>Phantom Pt. II</h3>
      <p>The more intense version of Phantom. Again, certified banger.</p>

      <h3>Valentine</h3>
      <p>
        Another change of pace for the album, this one is more mellow and
        somber. I appreciate what it adds to the pacing of the album, and by no
        means take this as a bad thing, but it's just not one I find myself
        coming back to in isolation. Still great though.
      </p>

      <h3>The Party</h3>
      <p>
        This is one of the more divisive tracks on the album. I honestly don't
        think it's as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. It's a necessary
        build up and intro to the next track and the rest of the album really.
      </p>

      <h3>DVNO</h3>
      <p>
        Again, this is a track that I feel is underappreciated. I feel like I'm
        repeating myself, but I truly believe every track on this album is at
        least an 8/10.
      </p>

      <h3>Stress</h3>
      <p>
        To understand this track, you don't need to do much more than read the
        title. If stress (the emotion) had a sound, this is it. Harsh. Loud.
        Intense. Brilliant.
      </p>

      <h3>Waters of Nazareth</h3>
      <p>
        This is the crescendo of the album, and as such it is one of my
        favourites. Absolutely amazing.
      </p>

      <h3>One Minute to Midnight</h3>
      <p>
        A fitting outro to the album. The perfect cooldown after the storm that
        was the Waters of Nazareth.
      </p>

      <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        People go on about the idea of a "no skips album", which until I heard
        Cross I could never really name one. Cross is a 11/10, no skips album.
        Every element of this album is perfect. As I write this it's late at
        night and I've listened to the album at least 5 times top to bottom
        tonight, on repeat. I'm truly mesmerised and lost in a gritty disco
        trance. I don't care what your taste in music is, you must hear this at
        least once in your life. Timeless classic.
