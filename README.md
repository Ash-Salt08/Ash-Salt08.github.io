# Ash's Web Space

This is my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages, inspired by old 90s websites and such.
Have a look at **https://ash-salt08.github.io/**.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS
- Hosted via GitHub Pages
- Manually written (ok maybe a little AI), no frameworks

## Why?

Because the web used to be personal, chaotic, and fun. I want that energy back. This is way cooler and way more fun than just setting up a social media profile. If you're reading this, I encourage you to start a similar project too!

## Features

- Retro-inspired styling
- Custom pages and blog entries
- Pure HTML and CSS

Thanks for visiting!
